                The display mode completely changes the visualization of the
                graph panel. Itâ€™s like three panels in one. The main mode is
                the time series mode with time on the X-axis. The other two
                modes are a basic bar chart mode with series on the X-axis
                instead of time and a histogram mode.
                * 'time' - The X-axis represents time and that the data is
                  grouped by time (for example, by hour, or by minute).
                * 'series' - The data is grouped by series and not by time. The
                  Y-axis still represents the value.
                * 'histogram' - Converts the graph into a histogram. A histogram
                  is a kind of bar chart that groups numbers into ranges, often
                  called buckets or bins. Taller bars show that more data falls
                  in that range.

      the ability to reuse the query result from one panel in another panel can be a huge performance gain.
