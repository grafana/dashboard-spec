                The display mode completely changes the visualization of the
                graph panel. It’s like three panels in one. The main mode is
                the time series mode with time on the X-axis. The other two
                modes are a basic bar chart mode with series on the X-axis
                instead of time and a histogram mode.
                * 'time' - The X-axis represents time and that the data is
                  grouped by time (for example, by hour, or by minute).
                * 'series' - The data is grouped by series and not by time. The
                  Y-axis still represents the value.
                * 'histogram' - Converts the graph into a histogram. A histogram
                  is a kind of bar chart that groups numbers into ranges, often
                  called buckets or bins. Taller bars show that more data falls
                  in that range.
