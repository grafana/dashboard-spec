    Transformations process the result set of a query before itâ€™s passed on for visualization.
    They allow you to rename fields, join separate time series together, do math across queries,
    and more. For users, with numerous dashboards or with a large volume of queries,
    the ability to reuse the query result from one panel in another panel can be a huge performance gain.
